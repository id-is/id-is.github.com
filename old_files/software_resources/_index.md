# Evidence transfer

Description: Evidence transfer approach of combining categorical evidence to improve clustering tasks

Abstract: Official code repository of ["Evidence Transfer for Improving Clustering Tasks Using External Categorical Evidence"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03909). It includes the
implementation of all experiments (using TensorFlow), as well as the scripts used to produce the
figures displayed in the paper. It also includes all neural network
configurations described using [ANNETT-O](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02528).
The ANNETT-O description can be found
