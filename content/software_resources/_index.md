## Insights from the Dataset (Thodoris Aivalis)

**Abstract:** Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have emerged as powerful tools across diverse applications. However, their inherent complexity often makes them opaque, which in turn complicates understanding their decision-making processes. Furthermore, it is often important to understand the effect training data have in the generation process without having internal view of the model. As an example, this is important for when using artistic or copyrighted material, or for awarding royalties, etc. In response to this challenge, we present a novel, search-inspired approach contributing to the interpretability of generative AI models by analysing the influence of training data on model’s outputs. Our method offers observational or external interpretability, meaning that it operates by observing the outputs of a model and not its internal activation patterns. Subsequently, we consider a range of similarity metrics based on both raw as well as latent-space embeddings produced by a pre-trained network. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method by retraining local models, demonstrating its ability to uncover influential subsets within the training dataset. Furthermore, this work lays the groundwork for future extensions and analyses, including user-based evaluations with domain experts such as artists and photographers. Validating the importance of the retrieved training samples in generated specific content more accurately, will contribute to improved observational interpretability.

## Neuro Symbolic AI (Antonis Ganios)

**Abstract:** In recent years, neural systems have demonstrated highly effective learning ability and superior perception intelligence. However, they have been found to lack effective reasoning and cognitive ability. On the other hand, symbolic systems exhibit exceptional cognitive intelligence but suffer from poor learning capabilities when compared to neural systems. Recognizing the advantages and disadvantages of both methodologies, an ideal solution emerges: combining neural systems and symbolic systems to create neural-symbolic learning systems that possess powerful perception and cognition. The purpose of this presentation is to illustrate different categories of neuro-symbolic models and frameworks related to them.
