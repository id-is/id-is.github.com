      <description>Welcome to Intelligent Data - Intensive Systems
Nowadays, production and utilisation of large data volumes is ubiquitous. Multiple scientific domains, such as environmental sciences, remote sensing, etc., produce large-scale datasets useful in other scientific, social and technological domains. Expecting domain experts or policy makers to create efficient solutions for data-intensive research is not practical. At the same time, AI is emerging as a major enabler when it comes to utilisation and democratisation of data.</description>

      <description>Abstract : In recent years, neural systems have demonstrated highly effective learning ability and superior perception intelligence. However, they have been found to lack effective reasoning and cognitive ability. On the other hand, symbolic systems exhibit exceptional cognitive intelligence but suffer from poor learning capabilities when compared to neural systems. Recognizing the advantages and disadvantages of both methodologies, an ideal solution emerges: combining neural systems and symbolic systems to create neural-symbolic learning systems that possess powerful perception and cognition.</description>

      <description>Abstract : The engagement with the field of artificial intelligence, which has seen significant development in recent times, dates back to the mid 20th century. Transformers first mentioned by the paper titled Attention is All you Need whichintroduced a model utilizing the attention mechanism to establish connections between data in order to make predictions. Since then, numerous and diverse Transformershave been created, building upon and extending the original model. The purpose of this presentation is to illustrate the applications and results of Trnasformers in various fields, displaying at the same time challenges and limtations of those models.</description>

      <description>Reinforcing the AI4EU Platform by Advancing Earth Observation Intelligence, Innovation and Adoption
January 1, 2021 - December 31, 2023
 AI4Copernicus aims to make the AI4EU AI-on-demand platform the platform of choice for users of Copernicus data along the value chain (scientists, SMEs, non-tech sector). AI4Copernicus will achieve this by exposing AI4EU resources on DIAS (data and information access services) platforms, making it easy to procure computing power and large EO data, as well as to access training material and expertise.</description>

      <description>Open access for fusion data in Europe
September 1, 2019 - August 31, 2021
 The European fusion community has become increasingly collaborative over the last few decades with more experimental devices becoming available for broader groups of researchers. The diversity of devices is a great strength of the programme, but as each facility largely has developed their own data technologies, philosophies and access methodologies it has in some cases also presented challenges in sharing data even between collaborating scientists.</description>
